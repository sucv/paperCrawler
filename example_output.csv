CVPR2024,transformer,FlowerFormer: Empowering Neural Architecture Encoding using a Flow-aware Graph Transformer,0,Neural Networks and Applications,"Computer science,Architecture,Transformer,Encoding (memory),Computer architecture,Graph,Artificial intelligence,Theoretical computer science,Engineering,Electrical engineering,Voltage,Geography,Archaeology",http://github.com/y0ngjaenius/CVPR2024_FLOWERFormer.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Hwang_FlowerFormer_Empowering_Neural_Architecture_Encoding_using_a_Flow-aware_Graph_Transformer_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,"Dongyeong Hwang, Hyunju Kim, Sunwoo Kim, Kijung Shin",The success of a specific neural network architecture is closely tied to the dataset and task it tackles; there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Thus considerable efforts have been made to quickly and accurately estimate the performances of neural architectures without full training or evaluation for given tasks and datasets. Neural architecture encoding has played a crucial role in the estimation and graphbased methods which treat an architecture as a graph have shown prominent performance. For enhanced representation learning of neural architectures we introduce FlowerFormer a powerful graph transformer that incorporates the information flows within a neural architecture. FlowerFormer consists of two key components: (a) bidirectional asynchronous message passing inspired by the flows; (b) global attention built on flow-based masking. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of FlowerFormer over existing neural encoding methods and its effectiveness extends beyond computer vision models to include graph neural networks and auto speech recognition models. Our code is available at http://github.com/y0ngjaenius/CVPR2024_FLOWERFormer.
CVPR2024,transformer,MADTP: Multimodal Alignment-Guided Dynamic Token Pruning for Accelerating Vision-Language Transformer,2,"Multimodal Machine Learning Applications,Advanced Image and Video Retrieval Techniques,Human Pose and Action Recognition","Computer science,Security token,Transformer,Artificial intelligence,Computer vision,Speech recognition,Computer network,Engineering,Electrical engineering,Voltage",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Cao_MADTP_Multimodal_Alignment-Guided_Dynamic_Token_Pruning_for_Accelerating_Vision-Language_Transformer_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,"Jianjian Cao, Peng Ye, Shengze Li, Chong Yu, Yansong Tang, Jiwen Lu, Tao Chen",Vision-Language Transformers (VLTs) have shown great success recently but are meanwhile accompanied by heavy computation costs where a major reason can be attributed to the large number of visual and language tokens. Existing token pruning research for compressing VLTs mainly follows a single-modality-based scheme yet ignores the critical role of aligning different modalities for guiding the token pruning process causing the important tokens for one modality to be falsely pruned in another modality branch. Meanwhile existing VLT pruning works also lack the flexibility to dynamically compress each layer based on different input samples. To this end we propose a novel framework named Multimodal Alignment-Guided Dynamic Token Pruning (MADTP) for accelerating various VLTs. Specifically we first introduce a well-designed Multi-modality Alignment Guidance (MAG) module that can align features of the same semantic concept from different modalities to ensure the pruned tokens are less important for all modalities. We further design a novel Dynamic Token Pruning (DTP) module which can adaptively adjust the token compression ratio in each layer based on different input instances. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that MADTP significantly reduces the computational complexity of kinds of multimodal models while preserving competitive performance. Notably when applied to the BLIP model in the NLVR2 dataset MADTP can reduce the GFLOPs by 80% with less than 4% performance degradation.
CVPR2024,transformer,Uncertainty-Aware Source-Free Adaptive Image Super-Resolution with Wavelet Augmentation Transformer,1,"Advanced Image Processing Techniques,Image Processing Techniques and Applications,Image and Signal Denoising Methods","Overfitting,Computer science,Transformer,Artificial intelligence,Wavelet,Domain adaptation,Regularization (linguistics),Image (mathematics),Adaptation (eye),Pattern recognition (psychology),Machine learning,Data mining,Artificial neural network,Classifier (UML),Physics,Optics,Quantum mechanics,Voltage",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Ai_Uncertainty-Aware_Source-Free_Adaptive_Image_Super-Resolution_with_Wavelet_Augmentation_Transformer_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,"Yuang Ai, Xiaoqiang Zhou, Huaibo Huang, Lei Zhang, Ran He",Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) can effectively address domain gap issues in real-world image Super-Resolution (SR) by accessing both the source and target data. Considering privacy policies or transmission restrictions of source data in practical scenarios we propose a SOurce-free Domain Adaptation framework for image SR (SODA-SR) to address this issue i.e. adapt a source-trained model to a target domain with only unlabeled target data. SODA-SR leverages the source-trained model to generate refined pseudo-labels for teacher-student learning. To better utilize pseudo-labels we propose a novel wavelet-based augmentation method named Wavelet Augmentation Transformer (WAT) which can be flexibly incorporated with existing networks to implicitly produce useful augmented data. WAT learns low-frequency information of varying levels across diverse samples which is aggregated efficiently via deformable attention. Furthermore an uncertainty-aware self-training mechanism is proposed to improve the accuracy of pseudo-labels with inaccurate predictions being rectified by uncertainty estimation. To acquire better SR results and avoid overfitting pseudo-labels several regularization losses are proposed to constrain target LR and SR images in the frequency domain. Experiments show that without accessing source data SODA-SR outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods in both synthetic->real and real->real adaptation settings and is not constrained by specific network architectures.
CVPR2024,transformer,EFormer: Enhanced Transformer towards Semantic-Contour Features of Foreground for Portraits Matting,0,"3D Surveying and Cultural Heritage,Image Enhancement Techniques,Advanced Image Fusion Techniques","Transformer,Computer science,Artificial intelligence,Computer vision,Portrait,Contour line,Natural language processing,Art,Cartography,Geography,Visual arts,Engineering,Electrical engineering,Voltage",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Wang_EFormer_Enhanced_Transformer_towards_Semantic-Contour_Features_of_Foreground_for_Portraits_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,"Zitao Wang, Qiguang Miao, Yue Xi, Peipei Zhao",The portrait matting task aims to extract an alpha matte with complete semantics and finely detailed contours. In comparison to CNN-based approaches transformers with self-attention module have a better capacity to capture long-range dependencies and low-frequency semantic information of a portrait. However recent research shows that the self-attention mechanism struggles with modeling high-frequency contour information and capturing fine contour details which can lead to bias while predicting the portrait's contours. To deal with this issue we propose EFormer to enhance the model's attention towards both the low-frequency semantic and high-frequency contour features. For the high-frequency contours our research demonstrates that cross-attention module between different resolutions can guide our model to allocate attention appropriately to these contour regions. Supported by this we can successfully extract the high-frequency detail information around the portrait's contours which were previously ignored by self-attention. Based on the cross-attention module we further build a semantic and contour detector (SCD) to accurately capture both the low-frequency semantic and high-frequency contour features. And we design a contour-edge extraction branch and semantic extraction branch to extract refined high-frequency contour features and complete low-frequency semantic information respectively. Finally we fuse the two kinds of features and leverage the segmentation head to generate a predicted portrait matte. Experiments on VideoMatte240K (JPEG SD Format) and Adobe Image Matting (AIM) datasets demonstrate that EFormer outperforms previous portrait matte methods.
CVPR2024,transformer,Joint Reconstruction of 3D Human and Object via Contact-Based Refinement Transformer,0,"Industrial Vision Systems and Defect Detection,Advanced Neural Network Applications,Image Processing and 3D Reconstruction","Transformer,Joint (building),Computer science,Artificial intelligence,Computer vision,Engineering,Structural engineering,Electrical engineering,Voltage",https://github.com/dqj5182/CONTHO_RELEASE.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Nam_Joint_Reconstruction_of_3D_Human_and_Object_via_Contact-Based_Refinement_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,"Hyeongjin Nam, Daniel Sungho Jung, Gyeongsik Moon, Kyoung Mu Lee",Human-object contact serves as a strong cue to understand how humans physically interact with objects. Nevertheless it is not widely explored to utilize human-object contact information for the joint reconstruction of 3D human and object from a single image. In this work we present a novel joint 3D human-object reconstruction method (CONTHO) that effectively exploits contact information between humans and objects. There are two core designs in our system: 1) 3D-guided contact estimation and 2) contact-based 3D human and object refinement. First for accurate human-object contact estimation CONTHO initially reconstructs 3D humans and objects and utilizes them as explicit 3D guidance for contact estimation. Second to refine the initial reconstructions of 3D human and object we propose a novel contact-based refinement Transformer that effectively aggregates human features and object features based on the estimated human-object contact. The proposed contact-based refinement prevents the learning of erroneous correlation between human and object which enables accurate 3D reconstruction. As a result our CONTHO achieves state-of-the-art performance in both human-object contact estimation and joint reconstruction of 3D human and object. The codes are available in https://github.com/dqj5182/CONTHO_RELEASE.
CVPR2024,transformer,TransLoc4D: Transformer-based 4D Radar Place Recognition,0,"Robotics and Sensor-Based Localization,3D Surveying and Cultural Heritage,Image and Object Detection Techniques","Computer science,Transformer,Radar,Electrical engineering,Engineering,Telecommunications,Voltage",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Peng_TransLoc4D_Transformer-based_4D_Radar_Place_Recognition_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,"Guohao Peng, Heshan Li, Yangyang Zhao, Jun Zhang, Zhenyu Wu, Pengyu Zheng, Danwei Wang",Place Recognition is crucial for unmanned vehicles in terms of localization and mapping. Recent years have witnessed numerous explorations in the field where 2D cameras and 3D LiDARs are mostly employed. Despite their admirable performance they may encounter challenges in adverse weather such as rain and fog. Hopefully 4D millimeter-wave Radar emerges as a promising alternative as its longer wavelength makes it virtually immune to interference from tiny particles of fog and rain. Therefore in this work we propose a novel 4D Radar place recognition model TransLoc4D based on sparse convolution and Transformer structures. Specifically a Minkloc4D backbone is first proposed to leverage the geometric intensity and velocity information from 4D Radar scans. While mainstream 3D LiDAR solutions merely capture geometric structures of point clouds Minkloc4D explores the intensity and velocity properties of 4D Radar scans and demonstrates their effectiveness. After feature extraction a Transformer layer is introduced to enhance local features where linear self-attention captures the long-range dependency of point cloud alleviating its sparsity and noise. To validate TransLoc4D we construct two datasets and set up benchmarks for 4D radar place recognition. Experiments show TransLoc4D is feasible and can robustly deal with dynamic and adverse environments.
CVPR2024,transformer,Transcending the Limit of Local Window: Advanced Super-Resolution Transformer with Adaptive Token Dictionary,6,"Advanced Image Processing Techniques,Adaptive optics and wavefront sensing,Advanced Vision and Imaging","Security token,Computer science,Transformer,Window (computing),Limit (mathematics),Speech recognition,Artificial intelligence,Electrical engineering,Voltage,Computer network,Mathematics,Engineering,Operating system,Mathematical analysis",,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/papers/Zhang_Transcending_the_Limit_of_Local_Window_Advanced_Super-Resolution_Transformer_with_CVPR_2024_paper.pdf,"Leheng Zhang, Yawei Li, Xingyu Zhou, Xiaorui Zhao, Shuhang Gu",Single Image Super-Resolution is a classic computer vision problem that involves estimating high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) ones. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) especially Transformers for super-resolution have seen significant advancements in recent years challenges still remain particularly in limited receptive field caused by window-based self-attention. To address these issues we introduce a group of auxiliary Adaptive Token Dictionary to SR Transformer and establish an ATD-SR method. The introduced token dictionary could learn prior information from training data and adapt the learned prior to specific testing image through an adaptive refinement step. The refinement strategy could not only provide global information to all input tokens but also group image tokens into categories. Based on category partitions we further propose a category-based self-attention mechanism designed to leverage distant but similar tokens for enhancing input features. The experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance on various single image super-resolution benchmarks.

Y. Mok",This paper presents a novel Kinematics and Trajectory Prior Knowledge-Enhanced Transformer (KTPFormer) which overcomes the weakness in existing transformer-based methods for 3D human pose estimation that the derivation of Q K V vectors in their self-attention mechanisms are all based on simple linear mapping. We propose two prior attention modules namely Kinematics Prior Attention (KPA) and Trajectory Prior Attention (TPA) to take advantage of the known anatomical structure of the human body and motion trajectory information to facilitate effective learning of global dependencies and features in the multi-head self-attention. KPA models kinematic relationships in the human body by constructing a topology of kinematics while TPA builds a trajectory topology to learn the information of joint motion trajectory across frames. Yielding Q K V vectors with prior knowledge the two modules enable KTPFormer to model both spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks (Human3.6M MPI-INF-3DHP and HumanEva) show that KTPFormer achieves superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. More importantly our KPA and TPA modules have lightweight plug-and-play designs and can be integrated into various transformer-based networks (i.e. diffusion-based) to improve the performance with only a very small increase in the computational overhead.

Existing methods have attempted to accelerate the training of ViTs yet typically disregard method universality with accuracy dropping. Meanwhile they break the training consistency of the original transformers including the consistency of hyper-parameters architecture and strategy which prevents them from being widely applied to different Transformer networks. In this paper we propose a novel token growth scheme Token Expansion (termed ToE) to achieve consistent training acceleration for ViTs. We introduce an ""initialization-expansion-merging"" pipeline to maintain the integrity of the intermediate feature distribution of original transformers preventing the loss of crucial learnable information in the training process. ToE can not only be seamlessly integrated into the training and fine-tuning process of transformers (e.g. DeiT and LV-ViT) but also effective for efficient training frameworks (e.g. EfficientTrain) without twisting the original training hyper-parameters architecture and introducing additional training strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToE achieves about 1.3x faster for the training of ViTs in a lossless manner or even with performance gains over the full-token training baselines.

In this paper we focus on the compression of DETR with knowledge distillation. While knowledge distillation has been well-studied in classic detectors there is a lack of researches on how to make it work effectively on DETR. We first provide experimental and theoretical analysis to point out that the main challenge in DETR distillation is the lack of consistent distillation points. Distillation points refer to the corresponding inputs of the predictions for student to mimic which have different formulations in CNN detector and DETR and reliable distillation requires sufficient distillation points which are consistent between teacher and student. Based on this observation we propose the first general knowledge distillation paradigm for DETR(KD-DETR) with consistent distillation points sampling for both homogeneous and heterogeneous distillation. Specifically we decouple detection and distillation tasks by introducing a set of specialized object queries to construct distillation points for DETR. We further propose a general-to-specific distillation points sampling strategy to explore the extensibility of KD-DETR. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and generalization of KD-DETR. For both single-scale DAB-DETR and multis-scale Deformable DETR and DINO KD-DETR boost the performance of student model with improvements of 2.6%-5.2%. We further extend KD-DETR to heterogeneous distillation and achieves 2.1% improvement by distilling the knowledge from DINO to Faster R-CNN with ResNet-50 which is comparable with homogeneous distillation methods.

Vision Transformers extract visual information by representing image regions as transformed tokens and integrating them via attention weights. However existing post-hoc explanation methods merely consider these attention weights neglecting crucial information from the transformed tokens which fails to accurately illustrate the rationales behind the models' predictions. To incorporate the influence of token transformation into interpretation we propose TokenTM a novel post-hoc explanation method that utilizes our introduced measurement of token transformation effects. Specifically we quantify token transformation effects by measuring changes in token lengths and correlations in their directions pre- and post-transformation. Moreover we develop initialization and aggregation rules to integrate both attention weights and token transformation effects across all layers capturing holistic token contributions throughout the model. Experimental results on segmentation and perturbation tests demonstrate the superiority of our proposed TokenTM compared to state-of-the-art Vision Transformer explanation methods.

We present a novel transformer-based method for GFIQA which is aided by two unique mechanisms. First a novel Dual-Set Degradation Representation Learning (DSL) mechanism uses facial images with both synthetic and real degradations to decouple degradation from content ensuring generalizability to real-world scenarios. This self-supervised method learns degradation features on a global scale providing a robust alternative to conventional methods that use local patch information in degradation learning. Second our transformer leverages facial landmarks to emphasize visually salient parts of a face image in evaluating its perceptual quality. We also introduce a balanced and diverse Comprehensive Generic Face IQA (CGFIQA-40k) dataset of 40K images carefully designed to overcome the biases in particular the imbalances in skin tone and gender representation in existing datasets. Extensive analysis and evaluation demonstrate the robustness of our method marking a significant improvement over prior methods.

However the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework called Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT) for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering full-length tokens resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. To effectively achieve this we propose a token pruning cluster (TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic diversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition we develop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e. Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that our method can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy compared to the original VPT models. For instance applying to MotionBERT and MixSTE on Human3.6M our HoT can save nearly 50% FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy and nearly 40% FLOPs with only 0.2% accuracy drop respectively. Code and models are available at https://github.com/NationalGAILab/HoT.

Kephart, Zijun Cui, Qiang Ji",While current methods have shown promising progress on estimating 3D human motion from monocular videos their motion estimates are often physically unrealistic because they mainly consider kinematics. In this paper we introduce Physics-aware Pretrained Transformer (PhysPT) which improves kinematics-based motion estimates and infers motion forces. PhysPT exploits a Transformer encoder-decoder backbone to effectively learn human dynamics in a self-supervised manner. Moreover it incorporates physics principles governing human motion. Specifically we build a physics-based body representation and contact force model. We leverage them to impose novel physics-inspired training losses (i.e. force loss contact loss and Euler-Lagrange loss) enabling PhysPT to capture physical properties of the human body and the forces it experiences. Experiments demonstrate that once trained PhysPT can be directly applied to kinematics-based estimates to significantly enhance their physical plausibility and generate favourable motion forces. Furthermore we show that these physically meaningful quantities translate into improved accuracy of an important downstream task: human action recognition.

In view of extremely slow convergence in typical DiT recent breakthroughs have been driven by mask strategy that significantly improves the training efficiency of DiT with additional intra-image contextual learning. Despite this progress mask strategy still suffers from two inherent limitations: (a) training-inference discrepancy and (b) fuzzy relations between mask reconstruction & generative diffusion process resulting in sub-optimal training of DiT. In this work we address these limitations by novelly unleashing the self-supervised discrimination knowledge to boost DiT training. Technically we frame our DiT in a teacher-student manner. The teacher-student discriminative pairs are built on the diffusion noises along the same Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE). Instead of applying mask reconstruction loss over both DiT encoder and decoder we decouple DiT encoder and decoder to separately tackle discriminative and generative objectives. In particular by encoding discriminative pairs with student and teacher DiT encoders a new discriminative loss is designed to encourage the inter-image alignment in the self-supervised embedding space. After that student samples are fed into student DiT decoder to perform the typical generative diffusion task. Extensive experiments are conducted on ImageNet dataset and our method achieves a competitive balance between training cost and generative capacity.

Block-level pruning has recently emerged as a leading technique in achieving high accuracy and low latency in few-shot CNN compression. But few-shot compression for Vision Transformers (ViT) remains largely unexplored which presents a new challenge. In particular the issue of sparse compression exists in traditional CNN few-shot methods which can only produce very few compressed models of different model sizes. This paper proposes a novel framework for few-shot ViT compression named DC-ViT. Instead of dropping the entire block DC-ViT selectively eliminates the attention module while retaining and reusing portions of the MLP module. DC-ViT enables dense compression which outputs numerous compressed models that densely populate the range of model complexity. DC-ViT outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot compression methods by a significant margin of 10 percentage points along with lower latency in the compression of ViT and its variants.
